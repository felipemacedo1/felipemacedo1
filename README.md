I'm a **Back-End Developer** who has been building my skillset in **Go** and **Java**, and exploring areas like **Cloud Computing** and **Cryptography**. I graduated from the **Generation Brazil Java Full Stack bootcamp**, which gave me a strong foundation in **Java** and **Spring Boot**. This bootcamp really helped me understand how to create web applications, and since then, I've continued learning and working on side projects.

After the bootcamp, I had the opportunity to work on **payment solutions**, where I gained familiarity with tools like **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, and **AWS**. I'm now participating in the **AWS-restart program**, which is helping me further expand my understanding of cloud technologies and how to use AWS effectively.

Though I’m still growing as a developer, I enjoy working on projects that challenge me to improve my skills in **building scalable systems** and ensuring **security and performance**, particularly in areas like **financial technology**.

### Current Project:
- **[CryptoTool](https://github.com/shem-org/CryptoTool)**: An educational tool focused on the implementation of cryptographic algorithms in Go. The project supports various encryption techniques and aims to become a library for encrypting and decrypting data in future projects.

<!--
### Some Projects:
- **[CryptoTool](https://github.com/shem-org/CryptoTool)**: An educational cryptography tool where I'm learning about encryption algorithms such as AES and RSA. It’s also designed to be used as a library for other Go projects.
- **[go-antifraud-ms](https://github.com/felipemacedo1/go-antifraud-ms)**: A microservice for detecting fraudulent transactions, which I’ve been building to explore real-time data processing.
- **[transaction-consumer-ms](https://github.com/felipemacedo1/transaction-consumer-ms)**: A part of a microservices system focused on transaction processing, which has helped me understand better how microservices communicate.
- **[bash-go-project-structure](https://github.com/felipemacedo1/bash-go-project-structure)**: A simple bash script to automate setting up Go project structures, something I made to help me and others speed up project setup.
- **[spring-bookstore-management](https://github.com/felipemacedo1/spring-bookstore-management)**: A Spring Boot project to manage a bookstore, where I’ve applied a lot of the knowledge I gained during the bootcamp.

I'm still early in my journey, but I’m eager to keep learning, especially in areas like **cloud computing** and **distributed systems**. Feel free to check out my projects and get in touch if you'd like to chat or collaborate!
